## Mars Rovers - Design Notes
Upon reading the Mars Rovers problem, my first instinct was to create an SPA using frontend languages. However, the purpose of this exercise is to showcase my C# skills, so I decided to go with an MVC ASP.NET application.  I created a model, view, and controller for both the rover page (which takes in the user inputs) and the results page (which shows the updated rover locations). The turn/move logic was put into a separate utility file. Based on what I could gather from the instructions, I made the assumption that the number of rovers desired was two, however, the rover amount can be changed in the appSettings.json file. If I were to continue working on this project, I would add custom validation to the “Start Position” input field to make sure the first two letters in the string are positive integers within the grid range and that the last char in the string is a valid cardinal direction. Also, I would add the option to increase or decrease the amount of rovers via the user interface.
